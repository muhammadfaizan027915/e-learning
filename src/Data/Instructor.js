    about: 'Hi! I\'m Colt. I\'m a developer with a serious love for teaching. I\'ve spent the last few years teaching people to program at 2 different immersive bootcamps where I\'ve helped hundreds of people become web developers and change their lives. My graduates work at companies like Google, Salesforce, and Square. Most recently, I led Galvanize\'s SF\'s 6 month immersive program as Lead Instructor and Curriculum Director. After graduating from my class, 94% of my students went on to receive full-time developer roles. I also worked at Udacity as a Senior Course Developer on the web development team where I got to reach thousands of students daily. I\’ve since focused my time on bringing my classroom teaching experience to an online environment. In 2016 I launched my Web Developer Bootcamp course, which has since gone on to become one of the best selling and top rated courses on Udemy. I was also voted Udemy’s Best New Instructor of 2016. I\'ve spent years figuring out the \"formula\" to teaching technical skills in a classroom environment, and I\'m really excited to finally share my expertise with you. I can confidently say that my online courses are without a doubt the most comprehensive ones on the market.Join me on this crazy adventure!',
