        comment: 'HTML and CSS sections were good but when we got to JS, node, mongodb etc. For most of the examples he gives he says, "We will do it like this now, but in a real project you wouldn\'t want to do it like that\". Why not give examples that we would actually do? It\'s hard to learn solely on what NOT to do, as a complete beginner. Bottom line, if I had to build a website by myself, I wouldn\'t know how to do it.'

It is really annoying and distracting from the course content.'
